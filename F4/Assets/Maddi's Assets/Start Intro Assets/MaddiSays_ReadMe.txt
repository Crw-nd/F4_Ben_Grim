Maddi says read me.....


ðŸ›  Project Overview:
This Unity package contains the full Start Screen experience for the project:

Marvel Studios animated intro

Fade into customized Start Screen

"Start Experience" button

Smooth transition (with spinning logo) into the next scene ("EmbodimentScene").


ðŸŽ¬ Scene Flow:
Marvel Intro (video plays)

Fade to Black

Start Screen (background + logo + 4Button + start button fade in)

Player clicks "Start Experience"

"The Fantastic" logo and 4Button spin horizontally while the background and Marvel logo fade out

Transition into EmbodimentScene


âš¡ Special Notes:
A placeholder scene named "EmptyEmbodimentScene" has been added.

This is a temporary scene â€” pls replace it with the actual Embodiment scene that I'll send soon [it's my birthday weekend so I'm tryna take some down time ;) - but msg if you need any help, I will reply!]

The Start Screen scene assumes a NextSceneName = "EmptyEmbodimentScene" (can be updated easily in StartExperienceTransition.cs).

     hope you doing good,
     Maddi <3
